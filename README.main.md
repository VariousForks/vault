# Main module (index.js)

The main module provides simple method for interacting directly with the
vault, but it is recommended to use the [Ethereum](https://zipperglobal.github.io/vault/ethereum/index.html)
or [secp256k1](https://zipperglobal.github.io/vault/secp256k1/index.html) modules directly.

The main module requires initialisation and is provided when calling into
those modules. There's a 'testing' mode so you can develop offline.

This is the client modules for use on websites, licensed under MIT license. The 'server side' vault and it's
code can be found in vault-site/ and is AGPLv3 licensed.
